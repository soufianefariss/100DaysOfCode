# 100DaysOfCode
I am starting a new challenge 100DaysOfCode. My aim is both to deepen my programming skills (C,  Python) and also getting used to Git!

I will be doing a small project each day for 100 days. Through out this journey, I will try to explore different ideas ranging from algorithms & data structures and OOP to Functional Programming and problem solving in general.
